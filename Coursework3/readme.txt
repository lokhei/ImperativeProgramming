fractal filesize : 200.8 kB

I first got the header of th PGM file, (testing that the file has a PGM header) along with the height, width and maxval. 
Then I got stored the RGBA values into an array and stored the colour hexadecimal. I then drew a pixel for each colour by storing the appropriate values into the array.
I also did some test to check filename.
