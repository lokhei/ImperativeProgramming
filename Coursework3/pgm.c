/* Demo for writing a PGM image file.

Each PGM image consists of the following:

A "magic number" for identifying the file type. A pgm image's magic number is the two characters "P5".
Whitespace (blanks, TABs, CRs, LFs).
A width, formatted as ASCII characters in decimal.
Whitespace.
A height, again in ASCII decimal.
Whitespace.
The maximum gray value (Maxval), again in ASCII decimal. Must be less than 65536, and more than zero.
A single whitespace character (usually a newline).
A raster of Height rows, in order from top to bottom. Each row consists of Width gray values, in order from left to right. Each gray value is a number from 0 through Maxval, with 0 being black and Maxval being white. Each gray value is represented in pure binary by either 1 or 2 bytes. If the Maxval is less than 256, it is 1 byte. Otherwise, it is 2 bytes. The most significant byte is first.
