# ImperativeProgramming

Labs for COMS10008 Imperative Programming

All files can be compiled using `make filename`

## Week 1:

hello.c: Hello World Program

square.c: Squaring Program

interest.c: Interest Calculator

max.c: Finding maximum value of int

min.c: Finding minimum value of int

limits.c: Finding minimum and maximum value of other data types

## Week 2:

grades.c: Grade classification for final average mark


## Coursework 1

triangle.c: classifies triangle types (scalene, isosceles or equilateral)

(Can be run using `./triangle 3 4 5`)

visualise.c: visualises bit structure of the char and int datatypes

(Can be run using `./visualise char 7`)


## Week 5:

strings.c: custom versions of the string functions in the standard library

bits.c: converts a number into either a 32 bit binary or an 8-hex-digit-string

(Can be run using `./bits -h n` or `./bits -b n`)


## Week 6:

text.c: functions which handle strings, written as text objects


## Coursework 2

list.c: resuable library module for lists, implemented via circular doubly-linked lists with one sentinel node

network.c: representation of directed graph given an input string, and network operations 


## Week 10

uppercase.c: reads in a file as input, convertting all letters into upper case, and outputs into new file

(can be run using `./uppercase infile outfile`)

hexview.c: reads in file as input and prints the bytes on the standard output in hex

(can be run using `./hexview infile`)


## Coursework 3
sketch.c: reads in and visualises .sk files

(can be run using `./sketch sketchfile"`)

converter.c: converts a pgm file into a sketch file

(can be run using `./converter pgmfile"`)
